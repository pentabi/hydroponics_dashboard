# hydroponics_dashboard
A dashboard for the hydroponics we made in Introduction to the Practice of Engineering for Transfer Students course
My role was to create a dashboard to display all the data onto a screen. There was 5 data to display: pH level, light level, temperature, plant height, and plant growth. I displayed all the data using MATLAB Apps.

## Features
- Automatically updates the data every so many seconds/minutes since it uses a loop
- Can dip the pH strip using servo connected arudino automatically by pressing the "Dip pH strip" button. (borrowed code from a teammate in charge of reading the pH strip)
- Tempurature can switch between Celsius or Farenheit
- Shows the growth of the plant using a bar graph
